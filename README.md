## About This Repo

A project to learn about Social Network Analysis.  Uses Python with numpy and pandas to analyze the "Reality Mining" dataset from MIT.
Python was used for all of the useful data analytics tools, and there are various networks and graphs created from this data.

More python code in my repo soon.  Love this language.
